                Teachers, counselors, and educators alike have a lot to manage on any single day. Ideally, we strive to make authentic connections
                with all of our students every day in order to support their social-emotional development. This is where The Holistic Educator can help along the way.
                Check out the Student Roster tab to get started checking in with your students while keeping tabs on the check-ins you've already had. Use your previous
                 check-in with a student to inform the next conversation you start with that student or find patterns among all your students to inform group instruction.
