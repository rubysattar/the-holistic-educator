# The Holistic Educator - front end application

- The final version of this project will be an application that tracks connections teachers make with students to inform the support they provide students for social-emotional development or behavioral concerns.
- This project is near and dear to me as a huge advocate for social-emotional learning in schools. This application is a tool that many teachers who are tracking their connections with students will find helpful to ensure that they are reaching every student.

## Planning Story

- The first step in my planning process was to do market research. I asked other teachers about tools they wished to have in the classroom. Most teachers polled said they would like a way to keep track of which students with whom they have had check-ins.
